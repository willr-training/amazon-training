# Create tomorrow with Data and Machine Learning
Goal:
```
Join Glenn Gore, Worldwide Lead Solutions Architect, AWS, as he explores how Amazon business such as Amazon Go, Amazon Retail, Amazon Alexa, and Amazon Robotics use data and machine learning to innovate for customers. Youâ€™ll also hear from senior leaders in APAC businesses using data and ML to innovate for customers today.

# Definition of ML

- infer patterns from large datasets

# Stack

[image]
- sageMaker: markets for industry models

Three layers: bottom to top
1. Frameworks
2. ML services
3. AI services

example: 5G networks
- low latency of transactions in 5G networks
- no diff between local device and cloud processing

How ML helps:
- A/B testing for better UX
- Recommendation systems
- Speed to information

Speakers:
Al Lindsay - Alexa
Jenny Freshwater - Predict modelling of products
[] - ML scientist
[] - Amazon robotics in workplace of future

# Alexa
[Al Lindsay] - Alexa engine

Challenge:
- work with speech
- voice interaction vs visual
- integration of alexa with other devices

Role of ML:
- recognition of "hey alexa"
- what words are being said
- NLP: intentions of user
- conversational context

Advancements
Power of compute: more/bigger models

## Other features
Detection of smoke alarm or glass break - with notification
Finger printing
Recognition between commercials and real people
Whisper recognition (whisper to alexa)

## Important in innovation
- customer feedback loop from users

# Delivery products to customers
[Jenny Freshwater] - director of forecasting for Amazon.compute

## Challenges
- could not deliver solution in traditional supply chain model

## Key items
- Demand forecast required
- How much to buy (buying systems)
- Automating decisions of fulfillment centers
- Predict how/when/what every product from amazon

## Challenges in predictions
- predictions of fashion
- thousands of data variables used for a model

## Stack required for ML
- cloud hosting
- clients on aws

## Important
- experimentation with new models
- heavy experiments for periods of time
- innovation always **bottom-up**
- production ready environment

# ML for "Search" and "Recommendation systems"
[Mike Vogelsong] - ML scientist
- recommendation systems

## Problems
- How to find right product (users)
- How to make search experience better
- How to deliver relevant/contextual results to customers

## Solutions: "Searching"
- Lots of historical data
- Terms searched by people
- Patterns in how people search (misspellings, aggregate words..)
- How relationship between search and actual products

## Recommmendation systems
- Discovery of products
- Comparison between **relevant** Terms

## Other uses for ML than automation
- Augment human experience
- Build "labels" to tailor/learn from customers UX
- Robotics
  + variety of product types (huge)
  + handle product/sort through areas/ move through fulfillment centres

## Benefits from AWS services e.g. sageMaker
- No need to re-invent the wheel
- No need to have ML experts - traditional software development
- Deploy already solved algos

# Robotics at Amazon
[Amazon Robotics] - Tye Brady

## Solution:
- Human and machine interaction
- More productivity = more jobs

## New jobs created:
- Automation creates new opportunities
[image - customer delight]

## Key advantages of robotics (fulfillment centres)
- increases selection
- lowers cost
- right product, right time, to right people

# Common messages

## Key messages
- power of data lakes
- empower people to deliver no matter what

## Recommendations
- test quickly > experiments > what hypothesis to testing
- quick experiments = lower cost of failure
- + experiment = + insights

## How
- stack to empower people
- continuous dev > test > re-training > release
- iterative dev is important
